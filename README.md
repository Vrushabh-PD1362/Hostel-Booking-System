# Hostel-Booking-System
An online Hostel booking system is a web application that allows users to book hostel over the internet. The system typically includes a database of available PG properties, with information such as location, amenities, pricing, and availability. The goal of the project is to provide a efficient way for users to find and book Hostel accommodations.
